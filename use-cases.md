# AI in Microsoft EPM – Use Cases, Features, and Expected Outcomes

| # | Use Case | AI Features / Functionalities | Expected Outcomes / Benefits |
|---|----------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1 | AI support for Project Managers in managing projects | • AI automatically builds optimized schedules, reallocates resources dynamically, and predicts project delays using historical performance data. • A conversational AI assistant allows project managers to query status, risks, or resource availability in natural language. • AI recommends workload balancing to avoid resource underutilization or overload. • Intelligent alerts notify managers of potential bottlenecks before they escalate. | • More accurate project timelines and reduced delays. • Resource allocation becomes proactive rather than reactive. • Project managers spend less time on manual planning and more on value-adding activities. • Improved decision-making supported by predictive insights. |
| 2 | AI assistance for Directors in managing programs & portfolios | • AI consolidates data across multiple projects into interactive dashboards with health indicators, dependencies, and overall performance. • Heat maps visually highlight high-risk or high-cost projects. • Scenario simulations (what-if analysis) allow directors to test different funding or scheduling decisions before implementing them. • AI automatically flags redundant or overlapping initiatives. | • Directors gain real-time visibility into portfolio and program status. • Improved ability to balance resource distribution across portfolios. • Early detection of risks ensures programs stay on track. • Better governance through fact-based portfolio decisions. |
| 3 | AI for achieving business strategy objectives & measuring ROI | • AI maps each project to strategic objectives and continuously measures its contribution using KPIs. • ROI calculators powered by predictive analytics estimate financial and non-financial returns. • Dashboards link execution metrics with business strategy, ensuring measurable alignment. • AI provides scenario modeling for the impact of project continuation vs. cancellation. | • Clear visibility of how initiatives contribute to corporate strategy. • Evidence-based ROI tracking increases accountability. • Leadership can prioritize investments with stronger justification. • Resources are redirected to projects with highest strategic value. |
| 4 | AI for monitoring and enhancing PMO performance | • Automated KPI tracking across PMO processes (delivery success, budget accuracy, schedule adherence, compliance). • AI benchmarks PMO performance against internal historical trends and external industry standards. • Recommends improvements to methodologies and processes (e.g., Agile vs. Waterfall suitability). • Flags compliance deviations with governance frameworks. | • Increased productivity by automating reporting and analysis. • Continuous maturity growth of the PMO with actionable improvement suggestions. • Standardization of practices across projects. • More reliable delivery of organizational objectives. |
| 5 | AI for aligning strategic objectives with portfolios & projects | • AI continuously scores alignment of each initiative with strategic goals. • Misaligned or low-value projects are flagged with recommendations for corrective action. • Smart reprioritization engine reallocates funding and resources to initiatives with higher impact. • Predictive analysis shows how portfolios will influence key business outcomes. | • Stronger alignment between business strategy and execution. • Elimination of projects that don't add measurable value. • Increased ROI on organizational investments. • Strategic goals achieved faster and more efficiently. |
| 6 | AI for issue & risk management | • Predictive models identify risks before they materialize by analyzing trends, dependencies, and historical failure patterns. • AI auto-updates risk registers, categorizes risks, and ranks them by severity and probability. • Provides recommended mitigation strategies, including lessons learned from past projects. • Sends early warning alerts when thresholds are exceeded. | • Proactive risk management prevents costly surprises. • Lower probability of delays, cost overruns, and project failure. • Increased trust and confidence from stakeholders. • Projects are delivered with greater stability and resilience. |
| 7 | AI for project documentation | • Automatically generates project charters, progress reports, closure documents, and lessons learned using intelligent templates. • NLP algorithms summarize meeting discussions and create structured minutes. • Dynamic templates auto-fill with real-time data from EPM. • Lessons learned are extracted from past documentation and stored in a knowledge base. | • Faster preparation of standardized documentation. • Significant reduction in administrative effort. • Consistent, high-quality reporting across all projects. • Improved knowledge transfer and organizational learning. |
| 8 | AI for predicting challenges & supporting executives | • AI forecasts organizational risks such as budget overruns, talent shortages, or delivery delays using predictive analytics. • Provides executives with scenario planning to understand potential outcomes of decisions. • Dashboards present consolidated strategic risks with recommended interventions. • Suggests corrective measures and alternative strategies. | • Executives gain early warnings of business-wide challenges. • More informed, proactive decision-making at leadership level. • Reduced likelihood of costly surprises in strategic initiatives. • Greater alignment of leadership actions with business resilience goals. |
| 9 | AI for measuring and scoring Project Managers' performance | • AI-driven scoring engine evaluates PMs on multiple KPIs: delivery timelines, budget control, risk resolution, stakeholder satisfaction, and documentation quality. • Balanced Scorecard approach integrates financial, customer, process, and learning perspectives. • Real-time feedback from stakeholders, team members, and system data feeds into AI models. • AI predicts potential performance gaps and identifies areas needing support. • Benchmarking compares PMs internally and against industry norms. | • Fair and unbiased performance measurement. • Early identification of underperformance allows corrective action before failure. • Transparent, data-driven evaluations reduce subjectivity. • Tailored development and training plans improve individual capabilities. • Motivates PMs through recognition of top performers. |
| 10 | AI for developing and managing Project Managers | • Generates PM rankings and leaderboards to highlight top performers. • AI recommends career development paths, training programs, or certifications based on skill gaps. • Monitors workload and stress signals to prevent burnout/bottlenecks. • Predicts attrition risks by analyzing performance and engagement data. | • Builds a high-performing project management culture. • PMO leaders can assign critical projects to the most capable PMs. • Improved retention of skilled PMs. • Continuous upskilling aligns project managers' growth with organizational needs. |
